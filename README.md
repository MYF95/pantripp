# Pantripp app

This app is a training project done to learn ruby on rails.

The main idea of this app was an app to keep on check things users
bought and to know what they have in their pantries.

The app in its current version has:

-Users using the devise gem

-Products

-Lists

-Users having their lists.

-Lists having their product list.

With all CRUD operations.

Things left to do are:

Properly count the capacity of a pantry and calculate 
how many of each product would fit in it.

Better CSS

Implement a whole lot of tests.
